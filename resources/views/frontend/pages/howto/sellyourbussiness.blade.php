                    <p>Finding an investor is a significant change for you and your business, therefore it requires your decision on:
                   <br/> -	Why do you need an investor?
                   <br/> -	What kind of investor are you looking for (silent financial investor or strategic investor)?
                   <br/> -	What part of the business (shares) would you like to keep in your control after new investor steps in?
                   <br/> -	What is your role in the new structure?
                   <br/>  -	When do you plan the exit of the investor and on what terms?
</p>
                    <p>Your decision could be based on a variety of reasons. We unite 91 allows you searching for the investors under your requirements, whatever be the nature and the reason.</p>
